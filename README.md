Sure! Here's a detailed `README.md` for your project using the `arthpay-sdk` for integrating a payment gateway in your React Native app:

# ArthPay SDK Integration for React Native

This project demonstrates how to integrate the ArthPay payment gateway SDK in a React Native application. The SDK allows you to create orders, set customer details, and interact with ArthPay's payment processing system to manage payments.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- React Native environment set up
- ArthPay account with API credentials

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, make sure that you have installed all necessary dependencies, including the `arthpay-sdk` package. Run the following command to install the SDK:

```bash
npm install arthpay-sdk
```

### 2. Set Up React Native Project

Ensure your React Native project is set up properly. If you donâ€™t have a React Native project yet, create one using the following:

```bash
npx react-native init ArthPayExample
```

Then, navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd ArthPayExample
```

### 3. Add ArthPay SDK to Your Project

After installing the SDK, you can now use the `arthpay-sdk` in your project. In this example, we demonstrate creating an order and displaying a payment page in a `WebView`.

### 4. Update Android/iOS Permissions (if required)

Ensure that your project has the necessary permissions for internet access in the `AndroidManifest.xml` (for Android) or the necessary permissions in your `Info.plist` (for iOS).

For Android, update the `AndroidManifest.xml` to allow internet access:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

## Usage

1. **Initialize the SDK**: You will need your ArthPay credentials to interact with the payment gateway. These credentials are passed to the `ArthPayMerchant` constructor.

2. **Create Order**: You need to create an order using `CreateOrderRequest`, passing the order and customer details.

3. **Display WebView**: Once the order is created, the payment link is fetched and displayed in a `WebView` for processing the payment.

Here's the complete code for integrating ArthPay SDK in your React Native app:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
import { ArthPayMerchant, ArthpaySdkView, CreateOrderRequest, CustomerModel, OrderModel } from 'arthpay-sdk'

const App = () => {
  const [link, setLink] = useState("")

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      // Initialize ArthPay SDK with your merchant credentials
      const arthpay = new ArthPayMerchant("AP_DEV_EBxkdAvj06poKqDAsLEjHsiVVh8tZKxctfFTiT5a0Dc", "4f11mV8v5I6aYHgO4g72Rg==")

      // Create order info
      const order_info = new OrderModel()
      order_info.setOrderInfo("1231231")
      order_info.setCurrency("INR")
      order_info.setAmount("100")

      // Set customer details
      const customerDetails = new CustomerModel()
      customerDetails.setFirstName("John");
      customerDetails.setLastName("Doe");
      customerDetails.setChAddrStreet("John Nagar Road");
      customerDetails.setChAddrCity("Mulund");
      customerDetails.setChAddrState("Maharashtra");
      customerDetails.setChAddrZip("4000001");
      customerDetails.setChEmail("support@arthpay.com");
      customerDetails.setChMobile("+919876543210");

      // Create order request
      const orderRequest = new CreateOrderRequest(customerDetails, order_info, "https://google.com")

      // Fetch the payment link
      let link = await arthpay.createOrder(orderRequest)
      link = JSON.parse(link)
      setLink(link?.obj)

    })()
  }, [])

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ArthpaySdkView
        style={styles.webView}
        source={link} // The URL to load in the WebView
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
  webView: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

export default App;
```

## Key Components

- `ArthPayMerchant`: The main class for interacting with the ArthPay gateway, initialized with your API credentials.
- `OrderModel`: Used to set the details of the order, including order info, amount, and currency.
- `CustomerModel`: Represents customer details, such as name, address, email, and mobile number.
- `CreateOrderRequest`: Combines order info and customer details into a single request object for creating the order.
- `ArthpaySdkView`: A `WebView` component that loads the payment page URL generated by the SDK.

## Configuration

- **API Keys**: You must replace the placeholder values for your merchant credentials (`merchantId`, `apiKey`) in the code with the actual credentials provided by ArthPay.
  
- **Customer Details**: The customer details include the name, address, email, and mobile number. Ensure these are accurate and complete.

- **Redirect URL**: The URL (`"https://google.com"` in the example) is the URL to which the user will be redirected after completing the payment.

## Handling Errors

To ensure smooth integration, you should handle possible errors in the API calls. You can wrap your async code in a `try-catch` block and display appropriate error messages to the user.

```javascript
try {
  let link = await arthpay.createOrder(orderRequest)
  link = JSON.parse(link)
  setLink(link?.obj)
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error creating order: ", error);
  // Handle error (show error message, etc.)
}
```

## Conclusion

This integration enables you to leverage the ArthPay payment gateway for handling payments in your React Native app
